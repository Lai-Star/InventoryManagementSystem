# Inventory Management System for any Business Organisation

## Objectives

- To manage the inventory system of any business organisation (primarily working on it for my own online business).
- This inventory system stores the details related to the inventory (such as the brand, colour, size, etc.), stock maintenance, updating the inventory count, profit margin of each product, inventory turnover, etc..
